Patterns:
- Source: _COOKIE ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: substr_count_prm__<s>(needle) ==> Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Filters complete: Filters:[nums, letters, specials]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_plain
- Sink: pg_query_prm__<$>(db)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
