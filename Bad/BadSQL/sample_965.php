# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _REQUEST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: filter_var_prm__<c>(FILTER_SANITIZE_FULL_SPECIAL_CHARS) ==> Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Filtered(", &, ', <, >)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_plain
- Sink: mysqli_prepare_prm__<$>(db)

State:
- State: Bad
- Exploitable: Yes


# Exploit description

1. No enclosure and special chars are allowed -> SQL injection
